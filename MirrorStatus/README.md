# MirrorStatus

I like using mirrored volumes in Windows. They are simple to implement, and provide good redundancy. The problem is if one of the drives in a mirrored set fails, Windows does not notify you.

This module includes three functions that provide a notification about mirrored volume status.

* Get-MirroredVolume uses diskpart to get a list of mirrored volumes. It returns the volume letter, label and status as a custom PowerShell object.

* Get-UnhealthyMirror filters the list generated by Get-MirroredVolume to include volumes that do not have a status of "healthy"

* New-MirrorStatusToast generates a Windows toast notification based on the status of the mirrored volumes. It will either create a notification that all mirrored volumes are healthy, or create a notification for each volume that is not healthy. If the volume is not healthy, the notification will include the volume letter, label and current status.

I use a scheduled task that runs a script that calls the New-MirrorStatusToast cmdlet daily.
